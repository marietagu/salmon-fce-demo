# Salmon FCE Demo

End-to-end aquaculture data-engineering demo built to support my application for the Data Engineer role at the Cawthron Institute. It simulates daily salmon farm metrics (feed, biomass gain, FCR/FCE), enriches them with public daily temperature data (Open-Meteo), stores the merged dataset in MongoDB locally and Cosmos DB (Mongo API) in the cloud, and exposes FastAPI endpoints for range queries and summariesâ€”JWT-protected via Auth0 (optional for local dev). A lightweight React+Vite dashboard visualizes FCE/FCR and temperature over time with simple filters. Everything is reproducible with Docker and Make targets (seed data, run locally with docker-compose, deploy to Azure Container Apps + Static Web Apps). The project emphasizes transparent data provenance, cost-aware cloud setup, basic logging/health checks, and clear documentation, and is designed to be easily extended to real sensor feeds, multiple sites, and additional analytics.
